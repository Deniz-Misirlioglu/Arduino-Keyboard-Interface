# Arduino-Keyboard-Interface  
Hello All, This project was created to interface a PS/2 keyboard with an Arduino. ```AVR-GCC 13.2.0``` was used to compile and test this program. Platform.IO was used to compile and view the serial monitor however I have provided a compile script ```compile_script.py``` which needs to have an updated path to your AVR GCC.
